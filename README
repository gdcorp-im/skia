Patches

1. The AsWinding algorithm in Skia's pathops uses ray casting for containment testing. When the ray intersects path vertices exactly, the algorithm can incorrectly determine containment, leading to holes being filled.
   Multi-ray consensus approach that casts 3 rays from slightly different Y coordinates (0.0, -0.0003, +0.0003) and uses majority voting to determine containment. (@aharris1-godaddy)
